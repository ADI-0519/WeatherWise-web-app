WeatherWise is a smart weather application that provides real-time weather updates, a login system for personalized experiences, and daily outfit recommendations based on the weather and time of day. Users can quickly check the forecast and get tailored clothing suggestions to stay comfortable throughout the day.

How I Applied What I Learned from the Academy:

Front-end & UI Design: After learning how to use the useState, useEffect hooks alongside Tailwind CSS, I was able to create a landing page for users to access the weather.

Backend & Authentication: Implemented a login system via Authjs.

API Integration: Fetched real-time weather data using APIs and processed it to generate clothing recommendations using GROQ API.

Conditional Logic & Data Handling: Used logic to analanalyse weather conditions and determine the most suitable outfit choices based on temperature, rain, and time of day.

User Experience Enhancements: Ensured smooth navigation, responsiveness, and an engaging user experience.

Future Improvements: Generate images via Unsplash API, and enable options for users to save their clothes weekly.
